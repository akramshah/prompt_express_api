Application Title: Script'd Express API (Prompt Generator)

Script'd is a free-to-use, user-submitted prompt generator to help
people with writer's block. Once you create an account, you are able
to view random prompts as well as submit, edit, and delete your own. This
is the back-end application of the Script'd app.
